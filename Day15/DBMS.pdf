✅ DBMS (Database Management System)
Definition

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that is used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
It provides an interface between the user (or application) and the database.

Key Features

Stores data in files or hierarchical/network structures

Supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Ensures minimal data redundancy

Provides data security and backup

Allows multiple users to access data

Examples

Microsoft Access

XML databases

Hierarchical DBMS (IMS)

Network DBMS (IDMS)

Limitations

No strong relationship between data

Less secure compared to RDBMS

Does not follow any strict data integrity rules

✅ RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
Definition

An RDBMS is an advanced version of DBMS which stores data in tables (rows and columns)
and enforces relationships between tables using keys.

The concept is based on E. F. Codd’s Relational Model.

Key Features

Data stored in tabular format

Supports relationships between tables

Enforces constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, CHECK)

Supports SQL (Structured Query Language)

Ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

Provides high security and normalization

Examples

MySQL

Oracle

SQL Server

PostgreSQL

SQLite

Advantages

Eliminates data redundancy

Maintains data integrity

Easy data manipulation using SQL

Multi-user support

🔑 Primary Key
Definition

A Primary Key (PK) is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each record.

Characteristics

Must be unique

Cannot be NULL

Only one primary key per table

Used to establish relationships with other tables

Example
Student Table
-------------------------
StudentID | Name | Class
1         | Ram  | 10
2         | Rita | 9


Here, StudentID is the Primary Key.

Real-life analogy

A primary key is like a roll number or Aadhar number — unique for every person.

🔗 Foreign Key
Definition

A Foreign Key (FK) is a column in one table that refers to the Primary Key of another table, thus creating a relationship.

Characteristics

Can contain duplicate values

Can be NULL (unless restricted)

Ensures referential integrity

Helps link tables

Example
Student Table (Parent)
-------------------------
StudentID (PK) | Name

Marks Table (Child)
-------------------------
MarkID | StudentID (FK) | Marks


Here, StudentID in the Marks table is a Foreign Key referencing StudentID in the Student table.

Real-life analogy

A foreign key is like using someone’s Aadhar number in another form to reference their identity.
🟦 1. CREATE (Create a Table)
Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

Example

Create a table named students:

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    class VARCHAR(10)
);

🟩 2. INSERT (Insert Data Into Table)
Syntax
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

Example

Insert a record into students:

INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, class)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 15, '10A');


Insert multiple rows:

INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, class)
VALUES
(2, 'Anita', 16, '10B'),
(3, 'Kiran', 14, '9A');

🟨 3. SELECT (Retrieve Data)
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

Example

Select all columns:

SELECT * FROM students;


Select specific columns:

SELECT name, age FROM students;

🟧 4. WHERE (Filtering Records)
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example

Select students whose age is greater than 15:

SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 15;


Select student named "Rahul":

SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name = 'Rahul';

🟥 5. ORDER BY (Sorting Records)
Syntax
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;

Example

Sort students by age (ascending):

SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY age ASC;


Sort students by name (descending):

SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY name DESC;
